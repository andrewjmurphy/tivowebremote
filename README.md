# tivowebremote

A web page that displays an image of a Virgin Media TIVO remote control. Any buttons pressed on that image are translated into IRCODE messages and sent to the local TIVO box via TCP.

### Why?

I hate cables and I hate boxes, the only thing around a TV should be a nice clean wall. I also hate clutter. As a result my TV is wall mounted and my TIVO is on the other side of that wall, the remote control is in a box and I control the TV using one of the many excellent TIVO remote control android apps in the google play store.

The problem is that anyone else who wants to control the TV needs to install and configure the app, which is a pain. By running this web page on my home server they simply need to navigate to a local URL and start pressing buttons.
